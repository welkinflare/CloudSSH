### Core Components

| Component | File | Responsibility |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| **Worker Entry** | `src/worker/index.ts` | HTTP routing, API handling, WebSocket upgrade |
| **SSHSessionDO** | `src/worker/durable-object.ts` | SSH session lifecycle management, SSRF protection |
| **UserDBDO** | `src/worker/user-db.ts` | User data, server configs, rate limiting (SQLite) |
| **SSHSession** | `src/worker/ssh-session.ts` | SSH protocol state machine (connect→version→kex→auth→interactive) |
| **SSH Protocol Stack** | `src/ssh/*.ts` | Pure TypeScript SSH-2.0 implementation (transport, crypto, auth, channels) |
| **Frontend Terminal** | `frontend/src/terminal.ts` | xterm.js wrapper, trzsz integration, WebSocket management |

### SSH Protocol Implementation

This project implements a complete SSH-2.0 protocol stack:

| Layer | Implementation | Supported Algorithms |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Key Exchange** | `kex-curve25519.ts` / `kex-ecdh.ts` | curve25519-sha256, ecdh-sha2-nistp256 |
| **Data Encryption** | `crypto.ts` | aes256-gcm, aes128-gcm, aes256-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes128-ctr |
| **Integrity** | `crypto.ts` | hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha2-512, hmac-sha1 |
| **Host Keys** | `ssh-session.ts` | Ed25519, ECDSA P-256, RSA |
| **User Auth** | `auth.ts` | Password authentication, Ed25519 public key authentication |
| **Channel Management** | `channel.ts` | Session channel, PTY, shell, window-change |

### Data Flow

1. The user enters the host IP, username, and password on the frontend (or selects a saved server via GitHub OAuth).
2. The frontend establishes a WebSocket connection with the backend Durable Object.
3. SSHSessionDO receives the credentials and establishes a TCP connection with the target SSH server using `@cloudflare/sockets`.
4. SSHSession executes the complete SSH protocol negotiation (version exchange → key exchange → authentication → channel open → PTY → Shell).
5. Encrypted terminal data is bidirectionally forwarded between the frontend and SSH server via WebSocket.

## Quick Deployment

### Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account.
- Node.js environment (v18+).
- Cloudflare Workers Free Plan enabled (required for TCP Sockets and Durable Objects features).

### Steps

#### Method 1: Deploy via GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Create Worker App**: Log in to Cloudflare, go to Workers & Pages, click Create Application, connect your GitHub account, and select the forked repository.
3. **Build Command**: During deployment settings, enter `pnpm run build:frontend` as the Build command, then save and deploy.
4. **Access the App**: After successful deployment, access via the default domain `https://cloudssh.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.
5. **Bind Custom Domain** (Optional): Go to Worker Settings → Domains & Routes → Add, enter your domain and confirm.

> **Note**: To deploy a test environment, repeat the above steps on the `test` branch to create a separate Worker (e.g., `cloudssh-test`). The Durable Objects data between both environments is completely isolated.

#### Method 2: Local CLI Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newbietan/CloudSSH.git
   cd CloudSSH
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   pnpm install
   cd frontend && pnpm install
   ```

3. **Login to Cloudflare**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```

4. **Deploy Production**
   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy
   ```

5. **Deploy Test Environment** (Optional)
   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy:test
   ```

| Environment | Command | Default Domain | Description |
|-------------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Production | `pnpm run deploy` | `cloudssh.<subdomain>.workers.dev` | main branch code |
| Test | `pnpm run deploy:test` | `cloudssh-test.<subdomain>.workers.dev` | test branch code, DO data isolated from production |

> **Note**: Both environments bind to Durable Objects with the same `class_name`, sharing data completely. After deployment, you can bind different custom domains for each environment in the Cloudflare Dashboard (Settings → Domains & Routes).

#### Optional: Configure Turnstile Human Verification

To prevent malicious bot abuse, it is recommended to enable Cloudflare Turnstile verification:

1. **Create Turnstile Widget**: Log in to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to the Turnstile page and create a new Widget.
2. **Get Keys**: After creation, you will receive a **Site Key** (public) and a **Secret Key** (private).
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: In the Cloudflare Dashboard Workers settings, go to "Settings" → "Variables and Secrets", add the following environment variables:
   - `TURNSTILE_SECRET` = your Secret Key
   - `TURNSTILE_SITEKEY` = your Site Key
4. **Redeploy**: Run the deployment command to apply the configuration.

> **Environment Variable Type Recommendation**: It is recommended to set all environment variables as **Secret** type. Secrets are stored in Cloudflare's encrypted storage, separate from code deployments, and will not be overwritten or lost during redeployments. When adding variables in the Dashboard, simply select the "Secret" type.

> **Note**: Turnstile verification is session-level. After verification, all features are available for the current session. Closing the browser will require re-verification.

#### Optional: Configure GitHub OAuth Login & Server Management

With GitHub OAuth enabled, users can log in with their GitHub account and save/manage their frequently used SSH servers in a personal dashboard for one-click connections. When not configured, this feature is automatically hidden and does not affect the anonymous SSH connection functionality.

1. **Create a GitHub OAuth App**:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → [New OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
   - **Application name**: `CloudSSH` (customizable)
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://your-domain.com` (your deployed domain)
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback`
   - After creation, note the **Client ID**, then click **Generate a new client secret** to get the **Client Secret** (shown only once, save it immediately)

2. **Configure Environment Variables**: In the Cloudflare Dashboard Workers settings, go to "Settings" → "Variables and Secrets", add the following environment variables:
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` = your Client ID
   - `BASE_URL` = `https://your-domain.com` (your deployed domain)
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` = your Client Secret

3. **Redeploy**: If you just added the variables and are enabling the feature for the first time, you must delete the old deployment and redeploy to initialize the database.

> **Environment Variable Type Recommendation**: It is recommended to set all environment variables as **Secret** type. Secrets are stored in Cloudflare's encrypted storage, separate from code deployments, and will not be overwritten or lost during redeployments. When adding variables in the Dashboard, simply select the "Secret" type.

> **Note**: Server credentials (passwords/private keys) are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage. The encryption key is automatically generated on first use and securely stored in the database. During connection, credentials never pass through the frontend — they are securely transmitted via a one-time-token mechanism.

> **Important**: Enabling this feature for the first time requires a clean deployment (delete the old Worker first, then redeploy) to initialize the new Durable Object. Use `npx wrangler delete cloudssh` to remove the old Worker, then run `pnpm run deploy` to redeploy.

## Development

### Project Structure

This project uses pnpm monorepo workspace structure:

```
CloudSSH/
├── src/                    # Backend source (Cloudflare Worker)
│   ├── ssh/                # SSH protocol pure implementation layer
│   └── worker/             # Worker entry and Durable Objects
├── frontend/               # Frontend source (independent workspace)
│   └── src/                # TypeScript + xterm.js + trzsz
├── docs/                   # GitHub Pages static assets
│   └── theme-editor/       # Visual theme editor
├── scripts/                # Build scripts
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml     # pnpm workspace configuration
└── wrangler.toml           # Cloudflare deployment configuration
```

### Local Development

#### Environment Setup

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CloudSSH.git
   cd CloudSSH
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** (root and frontend separately)
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   cd frontend && pnpm install
   ```

3. **Login to Cloudflare** (required on first run, credentials are cached afterward)
   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```
   > **Note**: When using Wrangler Dev for local development, it connects to your Cloudflare account to access Durable Objects and TCP Sockets. Real SSH TCP traffic is forwarded through Cloudflare's infrastructure.

4. **Configure GitHub Actions** (Optional, for automatic deployment)
   
   If you want to deploy to your own Cloudflare account via GitHub Actions, modify the repository owner in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
   ```yaml
   if: github.repository_owner == 'your-github-username'
   ```
   Also configure the following Secrets in your repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API Token
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare Account ID

#### Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This command builds the frontend and starts the Wrangler local development environment, supporting:
- Automatic rebuild on frontend code changes
- Automatic reload on Worker code changes
- Full Durable Objects and TCP Sockets functionality

After the dev server starts, visit the local address shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8787`) to start debugging.

#### Common Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm run dev` | Build frontend + start Wrangler dev server |
| `pnpm run build:frontend` | Build frontend only (output to `frontend/dist/`) |
| `pnpm test` | Run tests |

#### Submitting Changes

**Do NOT create feature branches.** All changes must be committed directly to the `test` branch to keep the repository clean.

```
test branch (dev/test)  ──merge──>  main branch (production)
```

1. Switch to the `test` branch: `git checkout test`
2. Pull the latest code: `git pull origin test`
3. Develop and test locally
4. Commit and push directly: `git push origin test`
5. After testing passes, the maintainer will merge `test` into `main`

> **Note**: The `main` branch has protection rules that prevent direct pushes. All changes must be committed to the `test` branch first. Do NOT create `feat/xxx`, `fix/xxx` or any other feature branches — commit directly to `test`.
